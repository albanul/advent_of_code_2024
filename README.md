# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2024** repository!  
This project contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, written in **Go**.

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that run from December 1st to December 25th.  
Each day presents a new problem, and participants can solve them in any programming language of their choice.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day's challenge stored in its own directory:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ day01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test1.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test2.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ day02
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test1.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test2.txt
... (and so on for each day)
```

### Files per Day
- `1/main.go`: The solution for part 1 of the day's problem.
- `2/main.go**`: The solution for part 2 of the day's problem.
- `input.txt`: The puzzle input for the day.
- `test*.txt`: Optional test input files for testing solutions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.21 or later)

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the part's directory. For example:

   ```bash
   cd day01/1
   ```

2. Run the Go program:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. (Optional) Update the `input.txt` file with your personalized input from the Advent of Code website.
